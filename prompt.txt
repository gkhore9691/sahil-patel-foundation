You are tasked with creating a modern, minimal, and emotionally engaging landing page for an NGO named “Sahil Patel Foundations”. The NGO’s mission is to help poor and underprivileged children celebrate their birthdays, provide them with food, offer financial assistance, and accept all kinds of donations (clothes, books, toys, money, etc.).

You will be editing an existing Next.js boilerplate project. Your job is to design and build the complete landing page from scratch with a professional, modern, yet human touch.

General Guidelines

Keep the design super clean, minimal, and modern.

Focus on emotional storytelling with visuals and layout that connect to visitors’ empathy.

Use soft, warm, and trust-building colors (like white, light gray, pastel shades, and a highlight color such as orange, teal, or blue).

Typography should be modern, easy to read, and elegant. Preferably use sans-serif fonts like Inter, Poppins, or Nunito.

Layout should be responsive and mobile-first.

Use subtle animations and micro-interactions (fade-ins, smooth transitions, hover effects).

Maintain a professional NGO vibe, not corporate, but not overly flashy either.
